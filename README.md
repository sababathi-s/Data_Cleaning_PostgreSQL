# Data_Cleaning_PostgreSQL
Data Cleaning Using PostgreSQL

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of PostgreSQL for performing essential data cleaning tasks. Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data preparation process, ensuring that the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. The project focuses on cleaning a raw dataset using various SQL techniques in PostgreSQL.

## Key Features:

**Handling Missing Data:** Identification and management of NULL or missing values, replacing or removing them based on context.</br>

**Removing Duplicates:** Identifying and removing duplicate records from the dataset to ensure unique data points.</br>

**Date Formatting and Conversion:** Standardizing date formats and converting date strings into the appropriate PostgreSQL date type.</br>

**Data Type Consistency:** Ensuring that each column has the appropriate data type and fixing any inconsistencies (e.g., converting text to integers or dates).</br>

**Standardizing Values:** Ensuring values are consistent across the dataset.</br>
